        4) All arguments must be of the correct type and never pass a keyword argument that the method doesn't accept.
        5) If the function has method "wait_for_completed" always call it. if not, do not call it.
        6) Enclose each with ".
        7) Format these function strings as an array, use as many functions strings as you need.
        8) These method strings must not cause an error when passed as an arg into eval().
