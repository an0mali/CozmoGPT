        2) These methods must be at the end of your response and must begin with ;; do not put a space after ;;.
        4) All arguments must be of the correct type and never use a keyword argument that would cause an error.
        5) If the object has attribute "wait_for_completed" always call it. if not, do not call it.
        6) Enclose each with ".
        7) Format these function strings as an array, use as many functions strings as you need.
        8) These method strings must not cause an error when passed as an arg into eval().
        9) These method strings must result in you performing your desired action.
        10) Always end your response with this array.
